# Stratego
This is the two player board game of Stratego. Here, it is implemented as a console application.

The game can be installed directly by downloading the Installation folder and selecting the file called setup.exe

All of the code is in the Code folder.

Currently, the program only works on Windows. I am looking into implementing it for Linux.
